                                Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness
                                and recover without requiring special treatment.
                                However, some will become<br>
                                seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and
                                those with underlying medical conditions like
                                cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease<br>
                                or cancer are more likely
                                to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick without
                                COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.

                                The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the
                                disease and how the virus spreads. Protect
                                yourself and others from infection<br>s
                                by staying at least 1 metre apart from others,
                                wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your
                                hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when<br>
                                it’s your turn and
                                follow local guidance.

                                The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles
                                when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe.
                                These particles range from<br>
                                larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is
                                important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by
                                coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and<br>
                                self-isolate until you recover if you
                                feel unwell.
